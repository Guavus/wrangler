# Wrangler

Wrangler accelerator is used to apply data transformation directives to your data records. The directives can be applied either through the Data Preparation visual interface or by manually configuring the Wrangler accelerator to perform the required data transformations.

## Configuration

The following table describes the fields as displayed in the accelerator properties dialog box.

| Configuration Field | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Input Field         | No       | `*`     | Name of the input field(s) on which the directives must be run. The default value '*' indicates all fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Precondition        | No       | `false` | Filter condition (written in Java Extended Expression Language or JEXL) which is evaluated before passing a data record to the Wrangler for processing. This condition can be applied to all or specific columns in a data record (as per the JEXL expression). If the precondition is evaluated to true for a record, the specific record is filtered by the Wrangler accelerator.Â For example, body.contains ("OCS") can be used to filter all records in which the body column contains the string "OCS". |
| Directives          | Yes      | N/A     | All data manipulation commands to be executed by Wrangler. The Wrangler applies the specified directives to the input records and outputs the processed records in a new dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Failure Threshold   | No       | 1       | Maximum number of errors tolerated before exiting the pipeline processing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Precondition filter

The `precondition` filter performs filtering on your data records before delivering these records for data preparation. 

You need to specify a filter condition as a `JEXL` expression. If this filter condition is evaluated to `true` for a record, the Wrangler removes the specific record from the list of data records to be transformed. 

For example, to filter all header records from a CSV file where the
header record is at the start of the file, you need to specify the following filter condition:

```
  offset == 0
```

The aforementioned filter condition filters all records that have an `offset` of zero.

Another example is where you want to filter input records containing a substring 
''YCES' in any of the records. To do so, you need to use the following filter condition:

```
  body.contains("YCES")
```

This will filter all records that contain `YCES` anywhere in their `body` column.

## Directives

The Wrangler accelerator supports numerous directives and their variations. 
These directives are available as commands as mentioned below in [Available Directives](#available-directoves).

## Interractive Wrangling using DataPrep Service

DataPrep service supports many row transformation directives which are actually executed by the Wrangler accelerator when you run your data pipeline. For interactively applying these directives, click `Pipelines` to display the DataPrep user interface (UI). Next, select the file that will load the desired data into DataPrep UI. After the data is loaded, you can see drop-downs for each column which provide options to perform simple data transformations, such as parse, data type, format, and calculate. Apply these directives to parse or transform the data until it looks good enough to proceed to attaching next stage. However, these drop-downs do not contain the complete list of transformation functions supported by Data Preparation. It is recommended to use the command console to avoid errors.

Data Preparation provides a command console to help you run data transformation directives as shell commands. You can specify the directives at the command line and the results are shown immediately in the Data Preparation UI. The command console is visible at the bottom of the Preparation page. You can view all directives applied to your data on the `Directives` tab in the right panel.

Please find below the [DIRECTIVES CHEATSHEET](#directives-cheatsheet) to find mapping between the UI interractive column drop-down option and the corresponding directive command. Note that these UI options and commands have intuitive names to easily infer this mapping.

## Usage Notes

All input record fields are made available to the Data Prep directives when `*` is used as the input field to be transformed. They are in the record in the same order as they appear.

Note that if the Wrangler accelerator does not operate on all input record fields or a field is not configured as part of the output schema and you are using the `set columns` directive, you may see inconsistent behavior. Use the `drop` directive to drop any fields that are not used in the data preparation.

This accelerator uses the `emiterror` capability to emit records that fail parsing into a
separate error stream, allowing the aggregation of all errors. However, if the _Failure
Threshold_ is reached, then the pipeline will fail.
